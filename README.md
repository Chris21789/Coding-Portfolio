# Coding-Portfolio

## Description

This project will be my personal portfolio that I can use to showcase my talents as a developer. I can easily add links and images to new projects in the project section as I create them in the future.

## Installation

No installation is required for this project.

## Usage

To use this page click any of the top links in the nav bar to be directed to each section. Under the projects section, each project listed will have a clickable link that will direct the user to the project page shown in the portfolio. Finally, clicking the links in the contact me section will either attempt to use phone access to call me, default email function to create an email to me or direct the user to either my LinkedIn or Github pages.
